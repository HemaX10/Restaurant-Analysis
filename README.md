## Introduction
This project is a detailed data analysis of the Food Delivery Cost and Profitability dataset obtained from Kaggle. The objective is to answer specific business questions and uncover insightful patterns related to discounts, order times, and order frequency.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Food Delivery Cost and Profitability](https://www.kaggle.com/your-dataset-link). It includes data on food delivery orders, costs, discounts, and profitability metrics.

## Analysis Process
The analysis process consists of several steps to answer the following questions:
1. **How many discounts and the number of the discounts given?**
    - Identified the total number of discounts and categorized them by discount value.
2. **What is the average time of any order and its relation to the order value?**
    - Calculated the average order time and analyzed its correlation with the order value.
3. **What is the relation between the day of the week and the number of orders?**
    - Analyzed the order frequency across different days of the week to identify patterns.

## Results
Key findings from the analysis include:
- **Discount Analysis:** Identified [X number] of discounts given, with the following distribution: [distribution details].
- **Order Time and Value Relationship:** The average order time is [X minutes], and there is a [positive/negative] correlation between order time and order value.
- **Weekly Order Patterns:** The highest number of orders occurs on [specific day(s)], while the lowest occurs on [specific day(s)].
